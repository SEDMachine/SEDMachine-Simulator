# Ideas for improving the Simulator

- AstroObject Logging Module with full logging controller
	- Ability to simply enable and disable logger with calls
	- Maybe subclass the logger itself? or just append methods to it...
- AstroObject Simulator Module with stages, subcommands, etc
- Custom Frame Type for Lenslets, which can inherit from ImageFrame
- Frame Type priority for Object types
