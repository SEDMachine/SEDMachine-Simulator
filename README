Title: Simulation Scripts for SED Machine
Author: Alexander Rudy

# Introduction
This Program contains SEDMachine Simulation and plotting scripts. They are written in Python. These scripts rely on the AstroObject modules that I wrote, which are bundled here. As well, they rely on matplotlib, numpy, scipy and pyfits.

# Scripts

## `plot.py`
This script produces copious plots for the process of converting a blackbody spectrum (at 5000K) to pixel units

## `data.py`
This script does the same conversion as `plot.py` but does so silently, and only shows you the final image, no intermediary steps

## `blackbody.py`
This script does the same thing as `data.py` but does so for three different temperatures. It also plots the simple spectra for these three temperatures.
