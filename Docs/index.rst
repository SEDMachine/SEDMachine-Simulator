Welcome to SEDMachine Simulator's documentation!
================================================

SEDMachine Simulator generates images that might come out of the SEDMachine.

The simulator is designed to be used with a command line interface, called SED.script.py, which should handle all of the necessary actions for normal usage. For more detailed documentation, you can examine the implementation of the script in Runner, and examine the documentation for the simulator model itself.

.. Warning:: This is draft documentation. You use it at your own risk!
