# Choong: Blackbody

Attached are the codes from today.
They rely on the following Python libraries: matplotlib (plotting), scipy
(interpolation) and numpy (arrays), all of which are important scientific
python libraries.

# Nick: Simulation Code

Hi Nick,

I wanted to clarify some of the code I have from you, to make sure I am understanding all of the data correctly.

In go36.py, there are a few variables that I don't think I understand:

widthmm (this looks like the width of the focal plane in mm, as it is used to recenter the lenslet positions)

p1,p2 (columns 2 and 3 from the data file) appear to be pupil positions? In mm?
