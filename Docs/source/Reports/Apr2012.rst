The data-format simulator for SEDMachine can produce images from a variety of sources and under a variety of conditions. We can produce data-format examples at a variety of temperatures, and the simulator models, approximately, the effects of scattered light. We are considering the assumptions made in the scattered light simulations, and will refine them if necessary. The Simulator handles flat, sky, bias and dark images for various instrument configurations. As well, the simulator can be made to produce source-images from uniform sources mapped to a variety of positions on the CCD. The simulator does not yet handle data cubes. The data-format simulator does not handle partial illumination of lenslets spatially. Partially illuminating a lenslet will result in the correct intensity reduction, but will not affect the spatial profile of the resulting spectra. We are aware of this shortcoming and attempting to determine its effect, both on the predictive power of the data-format simulator, and on the performance of the data reduction pipleline.
