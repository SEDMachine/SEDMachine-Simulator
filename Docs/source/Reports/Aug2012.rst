The SEDMsim program has been mostly finished. It works with the pipeline written by Andreas Ritter at NCU, and simulates all necessary stages of the SED Machine instrument. There are one or two remaining minor bugs, and one desirable feature has not been implemented. The bugs include missing spectral orders near the corners of the images in some simulations, and the missing feature is data-cube intake and re-arranging. The bugs could be quick fixes, and the data cube intake would require some minor time to implement. Other than that, the program is ready for a production environment, and runs smoothly on the Tango server.
